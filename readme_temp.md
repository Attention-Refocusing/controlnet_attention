# ControlNet 1.1

This is the official release of ControlNet 1.1.

ControlNet 1.1 has the exactly same architecture with ControlNet 1.0. 

We promise that we will not change the neural network architecture before ControlNet 1.5 (at least, and hopefully we will never change the network architecture). Perhaps this is the best news in ControlNet 1.1.

ControlNet 1.1 includes all previous models with improved robustness. Several new models are added.
